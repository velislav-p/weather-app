This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather app
A simple weather app that fetches data from an API according to a user's location 
and displays weather data and messages based on the response.

### Getting started
Clone the repo and start the server.

The app will run on http://localhost:3000

**Requirements: Node ^7.6**
```
> git clone https://github.com/velislav-p/weather-app.git
> cd weather-app
> npm install
> npm start
```

If you get an error about the node-sass module, run this command:

```$xslt
> npm rebuild node-sass
```

### Running the tests
To start the automated tests with Jest in the interactive watch mode:

```
> npm run test
```
